# ExpressionEvaluator

A project I made a few years ago that takes a math expression and finds the answer, without using any third party libraries or eval().
I keep coming back to it to use it in my projects and improving it so I decided to put it on GitHub so other people can to.

To use, just call `evaluate_string(input)` on your string expression.
